<!-- mere cutomized notes -->
**template.py**
- writing all the files and folders which will be required

**we'll be using a readymade librry for exception thats why we wont make our custom exception file**

**we'll write logging code in project's constructor(\__init__.py)** taaki import krna thoda aur easy ho jayega
